# AlgorithmVisualizer
Web applications for sequential visualization of algorithms

## Current functionality
### Sorting:
1. Sequential visualization of the algorithm with a setted delay value;
2. The ability to stop and continue sorting at any moment;
3. Generatin a new random data array;
4. Ability to change the delay value in the algorithm (lower delay, faster visualization);
5. Ability to choose different sorting algorithms;

#### List of available sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort

### Pathfinding:
1. Sequential visualization of the algorithm with with a constant delay value;
2. Generatin a new random grid;
3. Ability to change the coordinates of the target node;
4. Ability to add and remove wall (unwalkable) nodes

#### List of available pathfinding algorithms:
1. A*
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
